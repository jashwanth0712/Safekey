## Getting Started

To get started with the encryption and decryption scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Install the necessary dependencies. Please refer to the specific script's documentation for any additional requirements.

3. Start using the encryption and decryption scripts in your project.

## Usage

Each script in this repository provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt data. The scripts typically accept input in the form of file paths or user input and output the encrypted or decrypted data to the console or specified file.


## Supported Algorithms

The encryption and decryption scripts support the following algorithms:

- AES-256
- RSA
- Blowfish
- Triple DES

Please refer to each script's documentation for more information on how to use these algorithms.
